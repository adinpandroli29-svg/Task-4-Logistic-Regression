AI & ML Internship - Task 4: Classification using Logistic Regression


📌 Task 4: Classification with Logistic Regression

Objective:
To build a binary classifier using Logistic Regression.

Dataset Used:
Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset (loaded from sklearn.datasets).

Tools Used:

> Python

> Pandas

> Scikit-learn

> Matplotlib

Steps Performed:

> Loaded binary classification dataset

> Split data into training and testing sets

> Standardized features

> Trained Logistic Regression model

> Evaluated using confusion matrix, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC

> Explained sigmoid function and threshold

Conclusion:
The Logistic Regression model successfully classifies malignant and benign tumors. The ROC-AUC score demonstrates strong discriminative performance.
